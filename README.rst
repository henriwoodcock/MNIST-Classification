MINST Classification
========================

This is my attempt at the MNIST classification problem. Often called the "hello world" of machine learning, I thought it was about time to give this a go. This reposoitory will be constantly updated as I attempt the problem with different models and different methods. 

Hopefully I will add some creative techniques and analysis when/if I get round to it.
